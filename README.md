There are some limitations in AspectJ when it comes to Annotations. This library resolves a few of them.

- The [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7178782/aspectj-pointcut-for-methods-that-override-an-interface-method-with-an-annotati/7466145#7466145_) thread can get you started. 

- I have also [blogged](http://dorianlabs.blogspot.com/2011/09/intercepting-inherited-annotations-with.html) about it here.
